## About Me

Hi there! I'm Yannis, a new passionate UI/UX designer from Greece with a love for all things design and web development. I specialize in creating visually appealing user interfaces and user experiences. But that's not all â€“ I also like to turn my design visions into reality by coding webpages with HTML, CSS, and by using frameworks like Bulma and others.

### What I Do

- UI/UX Design:  Crafting user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing interfaces that enhance the user experience.
- Front-End Development:  Translating design concepts into functional webpages, with a keen eye for responsive and accessible design.

### My Interests

I'm always excited to learn new frameworks and programming languages that can elevate the functionality of my designs as well as design tools and packages. I like to learn about new trends and ways of visual communication.
